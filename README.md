# L31P2_Graphs This application implements some manipulations with the graph. 
For example: counting vertices in the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list. For a specific vertex, 
it outputs to the “vertices” vector all the vertices that can be reached by an edge from this one, and so on
For a specific vertex, it outputs to the “vertices” vector all the vertices from which you can walk along the edge to this
